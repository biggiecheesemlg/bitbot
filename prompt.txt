Reply with a bias in the format of this dict . recommend a call/put/wait based on the photos attached and this criteria:


Creating a Fibonacci with the values to 0, 0.706, 0.618, 1, and 0.79. This will give you three main levels that look like this. These levels are what's called the Golden Zone.

or where price has the highest probability to reverse. But we're going to add a little bit more to it to make our edge even greater. First, find an uptrend marked from the low of the uptrend to the high of the uptrend. Once this is done, we now have our golden zone where price is most likely to reverse. But we can make this trade even better.


What I like to do is pair this with the fair value gap. So here we have a bullish fair value gap, but not only that, it's paired exactly within our golden zone. Wait for price to come to our golden zone and within the fair value gap, enter, set or take profit at the highs, set or stop loss below the golden zone.

Wait for price to enter INTO the Golden Zone AND Fair Value Gap, then look for confirmation (e.g., bullish engulfing or high-volume candle). Only then consider it a call.
